WARNING

* Using xcache or opcache is highly recommended.
  This way all cache files will get stored in opcache memory.
  It will increase filecache speed dramatically.
* Right now module provides only Cache class to replace BackdropDatabaseCache. No need to enable module. Just download it into modules folder and properly update settings.php
